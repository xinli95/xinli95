# Hi there, I'm Xin! 👋

I am an **Applied Scientist** focused on the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. I'm passionate about making complex AI concepts accessible and turning AI learning into a fun experience.

### 📖 My Book: AI-101
I am currently writing **[AI-101](https://xinli95.github.io/AI-101/main/intro.html)**, an open-resource book born from my personal learning notes. It is designed to be an accessible guide for anyone—from curious beginners to fellow practitioners—looking to demystify the mechanics of modern AI.

**Latest Updates:**
- ✅ **Transformers**: Deep dive into architectures.
- ✅ **RLHF**: Explaining theory behind PPO.
- ✅ **RLVR**: Understanding Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards.
- 🚧 **Evaluation** (WIP): Benchmarks, metrics, and frameworks for LLMs and Agent systems.
- 🚧 **Responsible AI** (WIP): Model safety eval, Moderation, Safeguard LLM.
- 🚧 *More chapters in progress—stay tuned!*

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Interests
- **Research interests:** LLM, Fine-tuning (SFT/RLHF/RLVR), Topic modeling, Evaluation, Inference optimization.
- **Tools:** PyTorch, Transformers, Unsloth, Smolagents, OpenJudge.
